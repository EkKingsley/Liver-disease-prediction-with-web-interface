# Liver-disease-prediction-with-web-interface

Building a model on liver disease dataset and build a web interface to recieve patient details to predict whether patient has liver disease or not.

In this project, I'll  be building a machine learning model to predict if a patient has liver disease or not. The model is saved after training and testing.
A flask web interface is built in order for users to use the system by entering the diagnoses of a patient and at the hit of the submit button
the result will be returned as positive or not.
